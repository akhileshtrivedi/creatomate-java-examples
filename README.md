# Creatomate Java Examples

This repository contains Java examples demonstrating the usage of Creatomate's API. As of now, (https://creatomate.com/) Creatomate does not have Java examples, so this repository aims to fill that gap and provide developers with practical examples to integrate Creatomate's functionality into their Java applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the Creatomate Java examples up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
